This Node.js application, built using Express.js and Axios, fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays 
it in a simple HTML format. Users can input a city name, and the app will retrieve information about the current temperature 
and sunset time for that location.

"dotenv": "^16.4.5",
"express": "^4.21.0",
"nodemon": "^3.1.7"
